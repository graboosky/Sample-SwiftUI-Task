# Sample-SwiftUI-Task
Some businesses might be interested in reviewing my programming skills and coding style. This is a sample task for recruitment purposes. The repository's goal is to test new features, patterns, approaches as they become available on iOS platform.

## What is it about?

It is very simple application for showing how to use **SwiftUI**. It is written with **MVVM+Coordinators** pattern in mind, **Core Data** for data persistence and **await/async** for networking. Although some external frameworks are used in this project, they are only here to speed up the process because "that part of the code would have to be written anyway" and are written entirely in Swift without any external dependencies.
